# Provide a well-structured README file that explains how to run the code and any dependencies for  creating a chatbot in python

Creating a chatbot in Python can be a fun and educational project. To help you get started, I'll provide a well-structured README file that explains how to run the code and any dependencies. You can use this as a template for your chatbot project.

# Chatbot in Python
# Introduction
This project is a simple chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot can engage in text-based conversations with users. It uses natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user input.

# Prerequisites
Before you can run the chatbot, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

Python (>= 3.6)
pip (Python package manager)
You can download Python from the official website python.org and install pip by following the instructions here.

# Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
git clone  https://github.com/TharunaSelviRavi/AIchatbot

Navigate to the project directory.
cd chatbot-python

Install the required Python packages using pip. It is recommended to create a virtual environment first to avoid conflicts with your system-wide Python packages.
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Run the chatbot application:
python chatbot.py
The chatbot will start, and you can begin interacting with it by typing your messages.

# Configuration
You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the config.json file. You can change the bot's name, response templates, or add new conversational patterns.

{
    "bot_name": "MyBot",
    "responses": {
        "greetings": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Hey! How can I help you?"],
        "farewell": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Have a great day!"],
   
    }
}
# Adding Custom Functionality
If you want to extend the chatbot with custom functionality, you can edit the chatbot.py file. You can define new patterns and corresponding responses in the conversations dictionar

conversations = {
    "pattern": ["response1", "response2", ...],
   
}

# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This Python Chatbot project is designed to create a simple text-based chatbot. The chatbot can engage in conversations with users, provide responses to user queries, and be customized for specific use cases.

# Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>

Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>=3.6)
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
You can install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install nltk

# Dataset Source <a name="dataset-source"></a>

# Dataset link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grafstor/simple-dialogs-for-chatbot

The chatbot's training dataset is based on the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus, which contains a collection of movie character dialogues. You can find and download the dataset here.

The dataset has been preprocessed to create patterns, responses, and intents for the chatbot. You can explore and modify the intents.json file to customize the chatbot's behavior.

# Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Follow these steps to set up the chatbot:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/TharunaSelviRavi/AIchatbot
cd chatbot
Install the required dependencies (as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section).

# Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To run the chatbot, execute the following command:

python chatbot.py
The chatbot will start, and you can begin typing your questions or messages. The chatbot will respond based on its pre-trained knowledge.

# Customization <a name="customization"></a>

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the intents.json file and the chatbot.py script. Feel free to add or edit patterns, responses, and intents to make the chatbot more tailored to your specific use case.
